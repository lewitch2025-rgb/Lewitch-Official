## important notice

This open sourced version dont contain any information that could potentially leak data.

## Welcome to Lewitch

Welcome to Lewitch. You probably found our website mostly because you watched our youtube channel, then joined the discord, then after a while you wondered if theres a website. Yes, yes indeed.

Most likely you are a side developer or experienced with code and you wanted to see how the website was made. Well its probably made with complete shit code because im not a top tier programmer.


## What does this website have to offer?

It offers merchandise and music related tools.

## What are some of the features?

### Web

YTD (youtube downloader) -- W.I.P (you dont know how fucking hard it is to hide a server from youtube.)

Splitter -- (Splits music into tracks (e.g. vocals, guitar, drums, etc..))
    
### Software

YTD (Youtube downloader) -- (Easy because you dont need a fucking server to work with)
lewitch Studio (DAW) -- (inspired by ableton) (WIP) -- (Not any time soon.)


## What are the lewitch libraries?

### webui framework

some of our gui is made with lewui.js our very own shitty gui framework. Your very welcome to use it or hell, even make it production code ready but its really just for creating our websites. Shit, maybe ill make a universal gui web framework myself.

### Why are you using ai for some of this?

Well when ai came out I got so excited that I just used ai for 90% of my code without even knowing
how it works. Yes, im learning now because I realise its not mine if its just all ai. And yk what? Instead of fighting ai im embracing it but not the way you think. Im not using 90 percent ai for all of my code I use it as a tool, a tool to help me understand whats wrong and whats going on in complex operations.


### What did you use ai for?

I used ai for errors and debugging code.
